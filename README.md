# CSE2102-Command-Line-Calculator

In this assignment we create a simple calculator in java that uses addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

Before we run the code we have to compile it first with this command:
```
javac CommandLine.java
```

Then we can run the code with this command:
```
java CommandLine
```

This code requires the user to provide arguments such as number(s) and an operator at the start.

An example of a command that can be use is this:
```
java CommandLine + 1 2 3
```

Which outputs 6.
